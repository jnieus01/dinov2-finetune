# DINOv2 Fine-Tuning and Production Benchmarking Pipeline

## Overview
This project is dedicated to implementing fine-tuning for the DINOv2 model and setting up a production benchmarking pipeline. The aim is to enhance the model's performance on specialized tasks by fine-tuning and to ensure robust, scalable deployment through comprehensive benchmarking.

**Model performance** - How accurately and effectively a machine learning model makes predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data. It is typically assessed using various statistical measures that depend on the specific type of model and the task it is designed to perform. Common metrics include:  

  - Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases processed.  
  - Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions in all positive predictions made, used often in cases where the cost of a false positive is high.  
  - Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified, crucial in scenarios where missing a positive case has severe implications.  
  - F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two in environments where both are important.  
  - AUC-ROC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, a comprehensive measure used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models.  

**Latency** - The time it takes for a model to make a prediction after receiving input. Low latency is important for many applications in order to ensure that the system reacts quickly enough to be practical and effective. Latency is influenced by factors like:

  - Model complexity  
  - Hardware capabilities  
  - Optimization of the model inference process  
  - Efficiency of the data processing pipeline  

**Memory efficiency** - The amount of memory a model requires to perform its tasks. This is particularly important for deploying models on devices with limited memory resources. Memory efficiency can be critical for:

  - Model Size: The disk space or RAM that the model consumes when loaded for inference.  
  - Memory Bandwidth: The rate at which data is read from or written to memory during model execution.  
  - Scalability: How well a model can be scaled across multiple devices or nodes without exponentially increasing memory requirements.  

Improving memory efficiency involves techniques like model compression, quantization, and pruning, which help reduce the model's size without significantly sacrificing performance.

## Model Details
The DINOv2 model, based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, is enhanced in this project to better adapt to specific domains or tasks through fine-tuning on targeted datasets.

## Benchmarking Strategy
This benchmarking pipeline evaluates the model on multiple fronts: performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), latency, and throughput under various system loads.

## Using the Pipeline

### Data Preparation
Use `load_data.py` to prepare the data for fine-tuning:
```bash
python load_data.py --data_path './data/'
```

### Fine-Tuning
To start fine-tuning the DINOv2 model with your dataset, run:
```bash
python finetune.py --data_path './data/' --output_path './models/'
```

### Benchmarking
Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model in a production-like environment using:
```bash
python production_benchmarking.py --model_path './models/model_final.pth'
```
